        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          It is Hashingmart's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
          information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
          Policy applies to hashingmart.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
          "hashingmart.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
          protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
          through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
          Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,
          how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
          disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies
          only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply
          to our collection of information from other sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we use the term "personally identifiable information" we are
          referring to information that is connected to your name or can be
          reasonably connected to your name. This may include IP addresses,
          e-mail address, mailing address, birthday, telephone number, photos,
          personal images you provide that could be used to identify you, or
          information about the products you purchase, when those data are
          stored with your name. Any information that is not connected to your
          name is not considered personal information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Hashingmart uses the personal information that it collects to provide
          you with products you order, information and services. We may use your
          information to track your purchase, order history and to contact you
          for account and promotional purposes. We may also use your personal
          information for other legitimate business purposes, including to
          detect and prevent fraud, to collect amounts owing to us and to
          maintain business records.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also passively collect information using various technologies
          (which cannot presently be used to specifically identify you) such as
          your site preferences, age, gender, language, time zone, income, and
          education (some of the information we ask for may be optional). We may
          use or disclose aggregrate information for any purpose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>
          When you provide us with personal information to complete a
          transaction, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or return a
          purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it
          for that specific purpose. If we ask for your personal information for
          a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly
          for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to
          refuse.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Consent Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>
          If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your
          consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or
          disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at
          help@hashingmart.com
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not in any way sell your personal information. We may share your
          information to ensure delivery of orders, or other legitimate reasons
          discussed more below, we may also disclose your personal information
          if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>
          If you choose a direct credit/debit card payment gateway to complete
          your order, then that payment processor stores your credit card data. It is encrypted
          through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
          Your order data is stored only as long as necessary to complete your
          order. When this is complete, your order transaction information is
          deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
          managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort
          of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
          information by our store and its service providers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Third-Party</h2>
        <p>
          We will share your personal information with third parties only in
          ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. In general, the
          third-party providers used by us will collect, use, and disclose your
          information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the
          services they provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We share personal information with service providers, some of whom may
          provide marketing assistance, and may also share information with
          other trusted brands whom they believe may be of interest to their
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and
          other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies
          in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for
          your order related transactions. For these providers, we recommend
          that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner
          in which your personal information will be handled by these
          providers. Do remember that certain providers may be located in or have
          facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either
          you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves
          the services of a third-party service provider, then your information
          may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that
          service provider or its facilities are located. If as a Canadian
          resident, your order is processed by a payment gateway located in the
          United States, then your personal information used in completing that
          order may be subject to disclosure under the United States
          legislation, including the Patriot Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website
          or application, you no longer are governed by this Privacy Policy or
          Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
          remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
          of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you provide us with your credit card information, the information
          is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored
          with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the
          internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS
          requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry
          standards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Links to External Sites</h2>
        <p>
          Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated
          by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to
          that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy
          Policy and terms of use of every site you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
          privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
          services.
